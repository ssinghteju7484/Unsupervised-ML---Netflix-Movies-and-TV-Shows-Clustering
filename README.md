# Project Title

Unsupervised ML - Netflix Movies and TV Shows Clustering

# Project Objective

To analyze and cluster Netflix content (as of 2019) using unsupervised machine learning to:

Perform exploratory data analysis

Understand content distribution by country

Assess if Netflix is prioritizing TV over movies

Cluster similar content using text-based features

# Dataset Source

Collected from Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine.

# Tasks Involved

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Identifying country-wise content patterns

Analyzing shift in focus from movies to TV

Clustering similar shows/movies using NLP features

# Libraries Used

Pandas (data handling)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

NumPy (efficient computations)

# Project Architecture Flow

EDA →

Data Cleaning (missing values, outliers) →

Feature Engineering (genre, director-based features) →

Pre-processing (feature scaling, TF-IDF) →

Model Implementation (clustering algorithms) →

Model Explainability (understanding clusters)
